Did I mistake you for a sign from God
Or are you really here to cast me off?
Or maybe just to turn me on
'Cause these days
I would be lying if I told you that
I didn't wish that I could be your man
Or maybe make a good girl bad

I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
The taste of the divine
You've got my body, flesh, and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
Nothing to say and nowhere to go
The taste of the divine");
